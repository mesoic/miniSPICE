# python-minispice
A SPICE simulator for Python

Python-minispice is a SPICE simulator in python. Minispice allows for the simulation of circits and calulation of node voltages in an arbitrary network. Current elements supported include: Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors, Voltage Controlled Current Sources, and Transistors. The core functionality of minispice allows for frequency analysis. 

The current version of minispice also includes many extra features including 

1) Calculation of input/output impedances of networks

2) Conversion between all twoport representations

3) Smith chart poltting modules 

4) Calculation of constant gain circles and stability circles

5) An additional plotting function for displaying results

See the examples showing: 

1) How minispice can be run from a standard SPICE file specifying elements and nodes 

2) How minispice can be run directly in a Python script
